#Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams (Ed. 2)
by Tom Demarco & Timothy Lister

##Part I: Managing the Human Resource
  + *pg.9* There is nothing more discouraging to any worker than the sense that his own motivation is inadequate and has to be 'supplemented' by that of the boss.
  + *pg.11* If you are charged with getting the task done ... there ought to be some provision for brainstorming, investigating new methods, figuring out how to avoid doing some of the subtasks, reading, training, and just goofing off.
  + *pg.14* That's not exactly productivity -- it more like fraud -- but it's the sate of teh art for many American managers. They bully and cajole their people into long hours. They impress upon them how important the delivery date is (even though it may be totally arbitrary; the world isn't going to stop just because a project completes a month late). They trick them into accepting hopelessly tight schedules, shame them into sacrificing any and all to meet the deadline, and do anything to get them to work longer and harder.
  + *pg.15* Overtime for salaried workers is a figment of the naive managers' imagination. Oh, there might be some benefit in a few extra hours worked on Saturday to meet a Monday deadline, but that's almost always followed by an equal period of compensatory "undertime" while the workers catch up with their lives.
  + *pg.16* Overtime is like sprinting: It makes some sense for the last hundred yards of the marathon for those with any energy left, but if you start sprinting in the first mile, you're just wasting time. Trying to get people to sprint too much can only result in tloss of respect for the manager. The best workers have been through it all before; they know enough to keep silent and roll their eyes while the manager raves on that the job has got to get done by April. Then they tak etheir compensatory underitme when they can, and end up putting in forty hours of real work each week. The best workers react that way; the others are wokaholics.
  + *pg.17* Productivity has to be defined as +productivity divided by cost+.
  + *pg.18* People under time pressure don't work better, they just work faster.
  + *pg.20* Managers jeopardize product quality by setting unreachable deadlines. They don't think about their action in such terms; they think rather that what they're doing is throwing down an interesting challenge to their workers, +something to help them strive for excellence+.
  + *pg.23* The trade-off between price and quality does not exist in Japan. Rather, the ideas that high quality brings on cost reduction is widely accepted.
  + *pg.24* Quality is free but only for those willing to pay heavily for it.
  + *pg.29* The decision to apply schedule pressure to a project needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child: If your timing is impeccable so the justification is easily apparent, then it can help.
  + *pg.34* The manager's function is not to make people work, but make it possible for people to work.
  
##Part II: The Office Environment
###War Games
  + Productivity Non-Factors
    1. Language
    2. Years of experience
    3. Number of defects -- there was no correlation between speed and bugginess
    4. Salary

  + Workspace
    1. How much dedicated workspace do you have? Top 25% - 78 sq ft. Bottom 25% - 46 sq ft.
    2. Is it acceptably quiet? Top 25% - 57% yes Bottom 25% - 29% yes.
    3. Is it acceptable private? Top 25% - 62% yes Bottom 25% - 19% yes.
    4. Can you silence your phone? Top 25% - 52% yes Bottom 25% - 10% yes.
    5. Can you divert your calls? Top 25% - 76% yes Bottom 25% - 19% yes.
    6. Do people often interrupt you needlessly? Top 25% - 38% yes Bottom 25% - 76% yes.

    + The data presented above does not exactly prove that a better workplace will help people to perform better. It may only indicate that people who perfomr better tend to gravitate toward organizations that provide a better workplace.

  + *pg.55* 55% of workers asked thought they had a better workspace at home than they did at work.
  + *pg.58* Anything you need to quantify can be measure in some way that is superior to not measuring it at all.
  + *pg.77* The next time someone proudly shows you around a newly designed office, think hard about whether it's the functionality of the space that is being touted or its appearance. All too often, it's the appearance.


##Part III: The Right People

  + *pg.112* A common feature of companies with the lowest turnover is widespread retraining.
  + *pg.117* In Austrailia, where striking uses up nearly as much labor time as working, there is a charming form of strike called *work to rule*. Rather than walk off the job, workers open up a fat book of procedures and announce, "Until you give us what we're asking for, we're going to work exactly to the rule." When the air traffic controllers do this, for instance, they can only land one plane every seven minutes. If doctors were to do it, an appendectomy would take a week. 

###Ways to Achieve Convergence
  1. Training: People do what they know how to do. If you give them all a common core of methods, they will tend to use those methods.
  2. Tools: A few automated aids for modeling, design, implementation, and test will get you more convergence of method than all teh statues you can pass.
  3. Peer Review: In organizations where there are active peer review mechanisms there is a natural tendency toward convergence.

  + *pg.119* **Hawthorne Efect:** Loosely stated, it says that people perform better when they're trying something new.

##Part IV: Growing Productive Teams

  + *pg.121* Good work experiences have always got a fair measure of challenge about them.
  + *pg.121* When a group of people fuse into a meaningful whole, the entire character of the work changes.
  + *pg.124* Organizational goals come in for constant scrutiny by the people who work for the organization, and most of those goals are judged to be awfully arbitrary.
  + *pg.125* Only at the bottom, where the real work is performed, does this [ability to incentivize employees to corporate goals] ingenuity fail. There we count on professionalism and nothing else to assure that people are all pulling in the same direction.
  + *pg.126* The purpose of a team is not goal attainment but goal alignment.
  + *pg.127* Things that matter enormously prior to jell (money, status, position for advancement) matter less or not at all after jell.
  + *pg.128* The difference between a team and a clique is like the difference between a breeze and a draft.

###Teamicide
  + defensive management
    + *pg.133* But once you've decided to go with a given group, your best tactic is to trust them. Any defensive measure taken to guarantee success in spite of them will only makek things worse.
  + bureaucracy
  + physical separation
  + fragmentation of people's time
  + quality reduction of the product
  + phony deadlines
  + clique control

  > Most organizations don't set out consciously to kill teams. They just act that way.

###Open Kimono
  + calling in well
    + *pg.144* This [calling in well] attitude is the exact opposite of defensive management. You take no steps to defend yourself from the people you've put into positions of trust. And all the people under you are in positions of trust. A person you can't trust with any autonomy is of no use to you.
  + the getaway ploy
  + there are rules and we do break them
    + skunkworks project 
    + *pg.147* People at all levels know whether some sensible insubordination is acceptable or not. People look out for their Open Kimono managers. They're determined to make them look good, even though the managers may botch an occasional decision. 
  + chicken with lips
    + working with who you want proves more important than on what you want
  + who's in charge here

###Chemistry for Team Formation
  + Make a cult of quality.
    + *pg.151* It binds the team together because it sets them apart form the rest of world.
  + Provide lots of satifying closure.
    + *pg.152* The chemistry-building manager takes pains to divide the work into pieces and makes sure that each piece has some substantive demonstration of its own completion.
  + Build a sense of eliteness.
    + *pg.153* People require a sense of uniqueness to be at peace with themselves, and they need to be at peace with themselves to let the jelling process begin.
  + Allow and encourage heterogeneity.
  + Preserve and protect successful teams.
  + Provide strategic but not tactical direction.

##Part V: It's Supposed To Be Fun To Work Here
  + *pg.159* Turning chaos into order is what drives people.
  + **Constructive reintroduction of small amounts of disorder**
    1. pilot projects
    2. war games -- idea to product hack days
    3. brainstorming
    4. provocative training experiences
    5. training, trips, conferences, celebrations, and retreats

  + *pg.174* **Sociology matters more than technology or even money. It's supposed to be productive, satisfying fun to work. If it isn't then there's nothing else worth concentrating on.**

##Part VI: Son of Peopleware
  + *pg.195*
  > And it should be considred that nothing is more difficult to handle, more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to manage, than to put oneself at the head of introducing new orders. For the introducer has all those who benefit from the old orders as enemies, and he has lukewarm defenders in all those who might benefit from the new orders.
  + *pg.197* **The fundamental response to change is not logical, but emotional**
  + *pg.208* Companies of knowledge-workers have to realize that it is their investment in human capital that matters most.

### The ultimate managment sin is:
  + Wasting peoples time.

    + status meetings are about status
    + early overstaffing
    + time fragmentation

  > The human capital invested in your work force also represents a ton of money. If your company employs a few thousand knowledge-workers, it could easily have enough invested in them to be the equivalent of a modern wide-body aircraft. Wasting the time of the huge investment is money poured down the drain.
